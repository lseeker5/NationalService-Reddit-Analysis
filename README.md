# NationalService-Reddit-Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with the code for a project that analyzed the posts of the National Service subreddit. 
The notebook includes data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, data visualization, prescriptive analytics, and machine learning model training and testing. 
The project aimed to gain insights into the experiences and opinions of individuals who are interested in or have participated in national service, 
and to explore themes and trends in the subreddit's content. 
The project is now completed, but the notebook is well-documented with explanations and visualizations throughout, 
and the code can serve as a resource or reference for future projects.
